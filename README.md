# acoustic-wave-reconstuction
Matlab optimisation algorithm to reconstruct acoustic waves from time-resolved X-Ray diffraction data

# The Folder structure is as followed:
code: holds main programs for the optimization algorithm  
support: holds the subroutines and convolution data  
workspace: holds the workspace with the measured or the synthetic data  

# Instructions:
run the "start"-script to begin with the optimization
